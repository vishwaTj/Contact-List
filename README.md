This is a contact list Application developed using ReactJS
  the file system for src is divided into two parts mainly
       1) CSS extension files and JS extension files

       There are two CSS files
         i) index.css --> to style the entire page
         ii) App.css --> to style the components inside the page
         
       There are 3 js files 
         i) index.js --> the main js file which alters the root elemnt of the main html div in the whole application
         ii) App.js --> this fills in all the functoinality, state variables and also lays out the basic skeleton of the page
         iii) Contact.js --> this fills in all contacts as cards
